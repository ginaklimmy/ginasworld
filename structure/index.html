    <div class="beach-dream">
        <p>
            I’m at some beach resort away from home yet my apartment is there I walk in and there is a party going on. Mom was in my room rearranging things and I’m really mad at her. I walk back in later and Tim is sitting there, chilling like a villan on my couch. Then I go down to the beach with my backpack, which is very full of sand, but I realize that I don’t have any shoes on. So I turned around to go back and I fell multiple times running into a lot of people. I saw that there were a lot of snakes, really tiny ones slithering by my feet to the sand, I was also carrying a can of cat food as i walked through the resort to go to the beach instead I ran into another person fell down. He got really mad at me these. He smiles very nicely going down a ramp. I fell asleep again, and I dropped the cat food everywhere. I walk with him to the beach while we’re talking to cats but one comes up to me and tries to bite my leg.
